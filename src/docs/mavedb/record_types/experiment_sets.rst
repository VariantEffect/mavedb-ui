Experiment sets
###################################

.. _experiment-sets-intro:

Experiment sets do not have their own data or metadata and are used to group related experiments,
such as when different functional assays are performed on the same target and described in the same publication
(`example experiment set <https://www.mavedb.org/#/experiment-sets/urn:mavedb:00000003/>`_).

In general, an experiment set should contain data for a single target.
It is not necessary to include all data from a single publication or research project under one experiment set.

Experiment sets are automatically created when the first associated experiment is saved. To subsequently add
an experiment to the experiment set, use the 'Add an experiment' button on the experiment set page.
