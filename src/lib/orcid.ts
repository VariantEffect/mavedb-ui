/**
 * Module that handles ORCID authentication via OAuth2.
 *
 * "Three-legged OAuth" is used here. We originally tried using third-party libaries -- primarily vuex-oidc, which in
 * turn uses oidc-client or oidc-client-ts for the actual OAuth2/OIDC authentication process. We ran into issues with
 * all OAuth2 and OIDC authentication flows:
 *
 * - With OIDC's implicit flow, the client does not need to manage a client secret; this is good for single-page
 *   applications whose source code is visible. This flow is supported by vuex-oidc v3 via oidc-client, though it is no
 *   no longer supported by the supported branches of these projects. However, the access token has a limited lifespan,
 *   and ORCID does not seem to support token renewal. (It does not return a renewal token, and its renew endpoint has
 *   an X-Frame-Options header that prohibits use in an iframe, so in any case we cannot renew silently.) So the user is
 *   logged out after 10 minutes.
 * - The preferred option would be OIDC's authorization code flow with PKCE, which is more secure than the implicit flow
 *   and still does not require a client secret. However, ORCID does not support PKCE. Plans to support it seem to have
 *   stalled. (See https://github.com/ORCID/ORCID-Source/issues/5977.)
 * - So we have opted to use three-legged authentication, which requires participation of the MaveDB API. In this flow,
 *   the browser client first obtains a code when the user signs into ORCID and grants permissions. It sends this code
 *   to the MaveDB API, which makes a second request to ORCID, this time exchanging the code and MaveDB's client secret
 *   for an access token and, in addition, the ID token (JWT) that we will subsequently use for authorization. These
 *   have a very long lifespan (which ORCID's OAuth2 service returns in the expires_in parameter, measured in seconds).
 *   Three-leggged authentication is not supported by oidc-client or oidc-client-ts, so the present module implements
 *   it.
 *
 * We could combine this module with the auth module that keeps track of user roles, but keeping the two distinct allows
 * us to provide authentication methods other than ORCID.
 *
 * This module is not normally accessed directly by Vue components; instead, they should use lib/auth.ts.
