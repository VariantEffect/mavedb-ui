Experiments
============================================

Experiments describe the data generated from performing a MAVE on a target.
This includes all steps of the experimental procedure up to and including high-throughput sequencing.
Library construction, assay design, and sequencing strategy are all described in the experiment
(`example experiment <https://www.mavedb.org/#/experiments/urn:mavedb:00000003-a/>`_).

.. seealso::
   Data analysis steps including read filtering, read counting, and score calculation are described in a
   :ref:`score set<Score sets>`.

Publications that perform more than one functional assay should be represented as multiple experiments organized under
a single experiment set, and each functional assay should be described in its own experiment record.
This still applies to experimental designs where the differences between assays were relatively minor,
such as varying the temperature or the concentration of a small molecule.

To assign a new experiment to an existing experiment set, use the 'Add an experiment' button on the experiment set page.

Replicate assays should not be reported as separate experiments,
instead the number and nature of the replicates should be clearly stated in the experiment's methods section.
