/**
 * A composable that provides authentication and authorization features to Vue components.
 *
 * This composable uses two pieces of code:
 * - The ORCID OAuth2 authentication module, lib/orcid.ts, which handles the OAuth2 authentication flow and stores
 *   credentials in localStorage; and
 * - The authorization store module, store/modules/auth.ts, which checks the user's roles after login.
 *
 * The user's authentication state, profile, roles, and active roles are exposed here, as are functions for logging in and out, so Vue
 * components should not need to interact with the store itself.
