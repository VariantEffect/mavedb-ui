Evaluating functional assays
===================================

.. _evaluating-functional-assays-intro:

When evaluating functional assays for their suitability in variant effect mapping studies,
consideration should be given to several key factors that can influence the quality and interpretability of the
results. These factors include the dimensionality of the assay, the method used, the biological mechanism
assessed, and the model system employed.

MaveDB uses a :ref:`controlled vocabulary<MAVE controlled vocabulary>` to capture these key aspects of functional assays
and generate concise summaries of :ref:`assay facts<assay facts>` for each score set. These summaries can
help users quickly assess the relevance and reliability of the data for their specific research questions.
