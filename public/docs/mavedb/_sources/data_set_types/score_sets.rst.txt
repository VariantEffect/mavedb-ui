Score sets
============================================

Score sets are records that describe the scores generated from the raw data described in their associated experiment.
This includes all steps following the high-throughput sequencing step, including read filtering, read counting, and
score calculations (`example score set <https://www.mavedb.org/#/score-sets/urn:mavedb:00000003-a-1/>`_).

Multiple score sets should be used when distinct methods were used to calculate scores for raw data described by the
experiment.
The most common use case for multiple score sets is when scores are calculated at nucleotide resolution and amino
acid resolution for deep mutational scanning data.

To assign a new score set to an existing experiment, use the dropdown at the top of the score set form.

When uploading results based on imputation or complex normalization,
it's recommended to upload a more raw form of the scores (e.g. enrichment ratios) as a normal score set,
and then use :ref:`meta-analysis score sets<Meta-analysis score sets>` to describe the imputed or normalized results.

Meta-analysis score sets
-----------------------------------

Meta-analysis score sets have all the same attributes as a regular score set,
but they are linked to existing score sets rather than an existing experiment
(`example meta-analysis score set <https://www.mavedb.org/#/score-sets/urn:mavedb:00000055-0-1/>`_).
